### 👩‍💻 Language Used:
All programs are implemented in **Python 3**.

---

## ✅ Problem-1: Calculator Using Class
- **File:** `program-1.py`
- **Description:**  
  This program defines a `Calculator` class that takes two numbers (`a`, `b`) as `float` and an operation as a `string` (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`).  
  It performs the respective arithmetic operation and returns the result. Handles division by zero gracefully.

## ✅ Problem-2: Generate Series – First `a` Odd Numbers
- **File:** `program-2.py`
- **Description:**  
  Given an integer `a`, this program generates a list of the first `a` odd numbers starting from 1.  
  Example: If input is `4`, output will be: `1, 3, 5, 7`.

---

## ✅ Problem-3: Generate Series – Based on Odd Ranges
- **File:** `program-3.py`
- **Description:**  
  This program generates a series of odd numbers based on a single integer input `a`.  
  - If `a` is odd, generate `a` odd numbers.  
  - If `a` is even, generate `(a - 1)` odd numbers.  
  Example: Input `6` will return: `1, 3, 5, 7, 9`.

## ✅ Problem-4: Count Multiples in a List
- **File:** `program-4.py`
- **Description:**  
  This program takes a list of integers as input and returns a dictionary showing the count of numbers divisible by each of the integers from `1` to `9`.  
  Example:  
  For input list `[1,2,8,9,12,46,76,82,15,20,30]`, output will be:  
  `{1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}`
